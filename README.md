Scaling the Attention Window:
Smaller scale values from the SpanPredictor result in smaller local attention windows, focusing attention on fewer tokens within the sequence.

Reasons for Reducing Window Size:
Focusing on key information, reducing noise, and improving computational efficiency.

Scaling Attention Scores:
Scale up the attention scores within the local attention mechanism inversely with the span_scale to increase focus on the remaining tokens within the smaller window.

Sharpening Attention:
Increase the contrast between high and low attention scores by applying a sharpening function or using temperature scaling in the softmax function.

Temperature Scaling:
Introduce a temperature parameter in the softmax function, where lower values result in sharper attention.

Dynamic Temperature:
Make the temperature adjust dynamically based on the span_scale, decreasing as the scale decreases to sharpen attention.

Interaction with max_rel_dist:
Ensure that max_rel_dist does not exceed the dynamically adjusted span_length to prevent out-of-bounds errors and ensure correct application of relative positional biases.

Key Considerations:
Avoid over-sharpening, experiment with alternative scaling functions, and thoroughly evaluate changes on the specific task.

Key Changes and Explanations:
Integrate temperature scaling and attention weight scaling within the AdaptiveSpanAttention module, calculate effective_span to prevent errors, and correct the global_attn call in HybridAttention.

Potential Refinements:
Explicitly set max_rel_dist in AdaptiveSpanAttention and ensure clear dependency between max_rel_dist and positional bias.
